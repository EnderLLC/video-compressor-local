# How to Compress Video Files Without Losing Quality

Video files can be huge, making them difficult to share or upload. In this guide, we'll explore how to compress videos directly in your browser using **Local Media Tools**.

## Why Compress Locally?

Most online converters upload your video to a server. This has several downsides:
- **Privacy Risk**: Your personal videos are sent to unknown servers.
- **Data Usage**: Uploading large files consumes bandwidth.
- **Speed**: Waiting for uploads and downloads takes time.

Our tool uses **FFmpeg.wasm** to process videos right on your device. No data leaves your computer.

## Steps to Compress

1. Go to the [Video Compressor](/compress-video) tool.
2. Drag and drop your video file (MP4, MOV, MKV supported).
3. Select your desired compression level (Low, Medium, High).
4. Click **Compress** and wait for the process to finish.
5. Download your smaller video file!

## Understanding Compression Settings

- **CRF (Constant Rate Factor)**: This determines the quality/size balance. Lower values mean better quality but larger files.
- **Preset**: 'Ultrafast' is quick but produces larger files. 'Veryslow' produces the smallest files but takes longer.
